# Data:

Since it was inefficient to store the large datasets of the study in the repo, I've included links to the datasets here.
You can download the datasets from the below links and put them in the data/ folder right next to the src folder.

1- DBLP: https://dblp.uni-trier.de/xml/dblp.xml.gz

2- IP flow: [find proper link]

3- The GPGraph dataset: It's a generated dataset and one that was not shared by the authors

4- Twitter link structure: Too big a dataset (200 GB on disk)
